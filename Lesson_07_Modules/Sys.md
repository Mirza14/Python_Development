# Introduction

- The sys module in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment. It allows operating on the interpreter as it provides access to the variables and functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

## File Handles

- stdin: File handle the process reads from.
- stdout: File handle the process writes to.
- stderr: File handles the process writes errors to.
