# Loops

- Python has two primitive loop commands:

*while loops:*

- With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
- With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
- With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

*For Loops:*

- A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

- This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

- With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

- for loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a for loop with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
