# Exception Handling

- The *try* block lets you test a block of code for errors.

- The *except* block lets you handle the error.

- The *else* block lets you execute code when there is no error.

- The *finally* block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

- The *assert* keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError.
