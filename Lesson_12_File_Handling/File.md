# File I/O

- Python can be used to perform operations on a file (Read, Write, & Delete).
- Text Files: .txt, .docx, .log, etc.,
- Binary Files: .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg, etc.,
- All the files are stored as bits (0 & 1) in the memory.

## Open, read, & close File

- We have to open a file before reading or writing.
`f = open("file_name", "mode")`
`data = f.read()`
`f.close()`
